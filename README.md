I'm aTokar, and I'm 20 years old. A university student who drinks little alcohol. I'm not funny unfortunately :(
I hope my uploaded projects will convince you to move on to other profiles with good experiences. I like dogs and cats. I have a cat, you can see it here:

####(P.S.: I live in Hungary, yes currently the most corrupt country in all of Europe, and yes, Europe is a continent and not a country)
